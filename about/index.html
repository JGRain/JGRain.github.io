<h4 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h4><p>First of all, many people have asked about donation, so here it is!</p>
<p>Second, in all good conscience, most of the visible costs (like the domain fees) are already covered by us. We also spend tremendous time to keep Hexo running and functioning. This is the real cost and also invisible.</p>
<h4 id="Benefits"><a href="#Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h4><p>We are grateful for every penny donated, here is a list of benefits you and us can achieve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cover our cost.</li>
<li>Motivate and acknowledge our work.</li>
<li>List your name on Hexo.io website (2.5k users and 10k pageviews per day!).</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two tiers of donation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less than $100, your name and website link will be on the donor list.</li>
<li>More than $100, your name, icon, and website link will be on the home page for at least one month (depending on the amount).</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, thanks for your support!</p>
